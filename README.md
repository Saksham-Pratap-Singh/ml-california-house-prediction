# California Housing Price Prediction

This project applies **Machine Learning** to predict California housing prices using the **California Housing Dataset** from Scikit-learn.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
- Implemented **Linear Regression** as a baseline model.
- Observed that Linear Regression resulted in:
  - Higher number of outliers  
  - No significant improvement with feature scaling
- Built an advanced model using **Random Forest Regressor**, which:
  - Improved accuracy
  - Reduced error rate
  - Handled outliers better than linear methods

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸ”¹ Key Steps
1. Data loading & preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Model training with Linear Regression  
4. Performance evaluation  
5. Random Forest implementation for improved results  
6. Model comparison  

## ðŸ”¹ Results
- **Linear Regression:** Lower performance, sensitive to outliers  
- **Random Forest:** Higher accuracy, more robust predictions
